"""Adaptive token-bucket rate limiter (per-tenant, per-connector-kind).

Each ``(connector_kind, tenant_id)`` pair gets its own AIMD token bucket.
On 429 / rate-limit signals from the connector the bucket halves its
fill rate; on sustained success the rate climbs back linearly toward the
configured ceiling. Mirrors the pattern every cloud SDK has
implemented in different shapes (boto3 adaptive mode, Google
``RetryPolicy``, Slack ``AsyncRateLimitErrorRetryHandler``) and gives
connectors a uniform back-pressure interface.

Wire-compatible with pleno-anonymize's ``pleno_pii_scanner.scheduler.rate_limit``
so the bridge wheel can pass a saas-retriever connector to the
pleno-anonymize scheduler without translation.
