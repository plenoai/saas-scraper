"""Storage-format XHTML → plain text conversion for Confluence pages.

Confluence stores page bodies in a custom XHTML dialect ("storage
format"). It mixes vanilla HTML (`<p>`, `<ul>`, `<a>`, `<table>`,
`<code>`) with namespaced macros under the `ac:` (Atlassian Confluence)
and `ri:` (Resource Identifier) namespaces. The macros wrap operator-
authored prose — `<ac:structured-macro ac:name="info">` for info
panels, `<ac:structured-macro ac:name="code">` for code blocks, etc.
The user-visible text inside a macro is conventionally under
`<ac:rich-text-body>` (free-form prose) or `<ac:plain-text-body>`
(verbatim, often wrapped in CDATA).

The detector pipeline only cares about the surface text the operator
sees — no formatting, no macro names. We therefore:

1. Wrap the body in a synthetic root with the required namespace
   declarations so `xml.etree.ElementTree` can parse it (otherwise
   prefixed elements raise `unbound prefix`).
2. Walk the tree, extracting text nodes, joining sibling blocks with
   newlines so paragraphs / list items stay separated.
3. On any parse failure (Confluence has historically emitted invalid
   XHTML — bare `&nbsp;` entities, unclosed `<br>`, mismatched macro
   end tags) fall back to a tag-stripping regex so we never lose a
   page's text just because the storage parser got upset.

This is intentionally not a full HTML→Markdown converter; the detector
runs on raw text and treats markup as noise.
